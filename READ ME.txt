1- Organized the folder structure
2- changed home.html to index.html because (index.html page is the default page shown on a website if no other page is specified when a visitor requests the site)
3- UI wise you can't use too many fonts it's not optimal 
4- I suggest you make a logo instead of writing RC in Nav try this site ( https://www.canva.com/create/logos/ )
5- PLEASE DON'T USE POSITION ABSOLUTE  ( Not Dynamic )
6- Complains image (https://ibb.co/8BWtvgn) must be changed (Sad faces make the users not comfortable)  try something like this (https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/meeting_10219680?term=argument&page=1&position=14&origin=search&related_id=10219680)
7- the navbar needs to be responsive
